- 🕊️ Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- 🎓 Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- 🌍 Focusing on what is best for the community
- 💖 Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- 🚫 Public or private harassment

## Our Responsibilities 🛠️

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement ⚖️

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at jmcgraw@g.harvard.edu. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
